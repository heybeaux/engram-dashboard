TICKET: HEY-411
SUMMARY: Fix Raw Data button on emails page collapsing card on mobile

WORKTREE PATH: /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686

SPEC:
# HEY-411: Emails page 'Raw Data' button blocked by UI

## Problem

On mobile devices, tapping 'Raw Data' on the emails dashboard page causes the entire card to collapse, rather than expanding to show the raw data payload. Works fine on desktop.

## Target Files

- `src/app/(dashboard)/emails/email-detail.tsx` — this is where the email detail card and Raw Data toggle lives

## Root Cause

Most likely an event propagation issue. The 'Raw Data' button click is bubbling up to a parent collapsible/accordion element, which toggles the card closed instead of expanding the raw data section. The button's onClick needs `e.stopPropagation()`.

## Required Fix

1. Find the 'Raw Data' button/toggle in `email-detail.tsx`
2. Add `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the click from bubbling to the parent collapsible
3. If the raw data section uses a separate accordion/collapsible, ensure its toggle doesn't conflict with the parent card's collapse behavior
4. Test that the parent card still collapses/expands correctly when clicking elsewhere

## Do NOT modify

- Any files outside `src/app/(dashboard)/emails/`
- The email table component
- The email filters component
- The sidebar or layout

## Acceptance Criteria

- Raw Data button expands to show raw data on click (doesn't collapse the card)
- Parent card collapse/expand still works when clicking the card header
- No regressions on desktop behavior


## FILE OPERATIONS — CRITICAL

All files you need to modify are in: /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686

You MUST use the exec tool with workdir="/Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686" for ALL file operations.
Do NOT use the Write or Edit tools — they are workspace-scoped and cannot reach the worktree.

To read a file:
  exec: cat /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686/src/some/file.ts

To write a file, use a heredoc:
  exec: cat > /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686/src/some/file.ts << 'ENDOFFILE'
  ... file contents ...
  ENDOFFILE

To make a targeted edit, use sed:
  exec: sed -i '' 's/oldText/newText/g' /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686/src/some/file.ts

For multi-line edits, prefer writing the complete file with cat/heredoc
rather than chaining sed commands. It is more reliable.

To verify your changes:
  exec: cd /Users/clawdbot/projects/agent-memory/.factory-worktrees/hey-411-1772397436686 && git diff --stat

## RULES

- Implement ONLY what the spec describes. No scope creep.
- Do NOT run git commands that modify history (no commit, no push, no branch operations).
  git diff and git status are fine for verification.
- Do NOT create PRs or interact with GitHub.
- Write clean, typed code that follows existing patterns in the codebase.
- If tests exist for modified files, update them.
- If you are unsure about something, implement the most conservative approach.
- ALWAYS use exec with the worktree path. NEVER use Write/Edit tools.

**Effective date: February 14, 2026**

These terms apply to your use of Open Engram ("we", "us", "our"), the API service available at openengram.ai, operated by Beaux Walton in Powell River, British Columbia, Canada.

By using Open Engram, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use the service.

## What Open Engram Does

Open Engram is an API service that stores and retrieves memories for AI agents using vector embeddings. You send us text, we generate embeddings, store both, and let you query them later. That's the core product.

## Accounts and API Keys

To use Open Engram, you need an account. You're responsible for:

- Providing accurate registration information
- Keeping your password and API keys secure
- All activity under your account and API keys

If you suspect unauthorized access, let us know immediately. We're not liable for losses from compromised credentials you failed to protect.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Store illegal content or use the service for illegal purposes
- Abuse, overload, or interfere with the service or its infrastructure
- Reverse engineer or attempt to extract our source code
- Resell access to the API without our written permission
- Use the service to build a competing product
- Circumvent rate limits or usage restrictions
- Store content that violates the rights of others

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms without notice.

## Your Data

**You own your data.** The memories, text, and metadata you send to Open Engram belong to you. We process and store it solely to provide the service.

We don't sell your data. We don't use your stored memories to train models. We don't share your data with third parties except as needed to operate the service (see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy.md)).

You can export or delete your data at any time through the API or dashboard.

## Plans and Pricing

Open Engram offers the following plans:

| Plan | Price |
|------|-------|
| Free | $0/month |
| Starter | $9/month |
| Pro | $39/month |
| Scale | $99/month |

Prices are in USD. We may change pricing with 30 days' notice.

## Payment

Paid plans are billed monthly through Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis.

- **Cancellation**: You can cancel anytime. Your plan remains active until the end of the billing period.
- **Refunds**: We don't offer refunds for partial billing periods. If you believe you were charged in error, contact us within 30 days.
- **Failed payments**: If payment fails, we may downgrade your account to the Free tier after a grace period.

## Service Availability

We aim for high availability but don't guarantee it. Specifically:

- **Free tier**: Best effort. No uptime commitment.
- **Paid tiers**: We make commercially reasonable efforts to maintain availability, but we don't offer formal SLAs at this time.

We may perform maintenance that temporarily affects availability. We'll try to give advance notice when possible.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- Open Engram is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind
- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages
- Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim
- We are not responsible for data loss — maintain your own backups

## Termination

You can close your account at any time. We can terminate or suspend your access if you violate these terms or for any reason with 30 days' notice.

On termination:

- Your API keys are immediately revoked
- Your stored data will be deleted within 30 days
- Outstanding payment obligations survive termination

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms. If we make material changes, we'll notify you by email or through the dashboard at least 30 days before they take effect. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of British Columbia.
